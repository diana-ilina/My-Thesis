**Thesis topic: "Genetic optimization algorithms usage in adaptive antenna arrays based on passive scatterers"**

My thesis was related to the use of genetic optimization algorithms in adaptive antenna arrays based on passive scatterers.

The problem of finding the optimal phase distribution (voltages across diodes) is very difficult due to a significant number of elements (of the order of several hundred), changes in the surrounding conditions, fluctuations in the parameters of the antenna elements, as well as a constantly changing signal level.

Autonomous optimization of an adaptive antenna is a kind of global optimization problem that is used to synthesize a radiation pattern whose maximum corresponds to a previously known direction to the signal source. This is achieved by selecting the voltage across the diodes diffusers to maximize the signal level at the active element.
